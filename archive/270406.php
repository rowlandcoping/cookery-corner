<p><b>Subject: Cookery Corner is back</b>

<p>...... without further ado, I wish to bring to public attention an oft misused and
underappreciated snack, the Pot Noodle (TM) .
 
<p>The Pot Noodle?  It's like boiling an egg - much harder than you think
(at least that's how my eggs turn out).  First, boil a kettle.  Any
kettle will do, but I prefer a faster boiling model, preferably with a
lime-scale filter.  This may cost more, but trust me it's worth it.
Whilst the kettle is boiling, remove the lid from the pot noodle, taking
care not to spill any of the powdery stuff, then remove the sachet of
sauce and place it to one side.  You will need this later.

<p>Next comes the phase where mistakes are most commonly made.  If you view
the inside of your pot noodle in the right light, you might be able to
see a marking known as the 'fill level'.  Once the kettle has boiled,
fill your pot to the fill line AND NO HIGHER.  It may be necessary to
force the congealed mass of dehydrated soya down into the pot in order
to reveal the true displacement of the snack.  This requires practice.
You may add the sachet on completion of this task (being careful not to
spray it everywhere on opening), or you can follow the instructions on
the side.  It's up to you.
 
<p>The final phase is also fraught with difficulty.  Many Pot Noodle users,
for whatever reason, will require food URGENTLY.  If this applies to
you, do not be tempted to delve into the snack before it is ready, no
matter how great it smells.  Wait until all the water has been absorbed
and stir thoroughly - this way there will be no crunchy bits and it will
not be overly loose in texture, allowing you to consume it as nature
intended.

<p>If anyone wishes to discuss Pot Noodle related issues further, or takes issue with
Cookery Corner's sage advice and wisdom, please don't bother to send your feedback</a>, as I will ignore and/or summarily dismiss it.
