<p><b>Subject: Cookery corner</b>

<p>After my breakfast this morning, I was so inspired by it I thought I
would start a post five thirty cookery tip stream of consciousness
corner.
 
<p>This one is especially for marmite eaters.  Obviously the scope for
variations on the toast and marmite theme is limited, but this morning I
struck inspiration.
 
<p>Simply add a layer of Philadelphia or other soft cheese on top, creating
an inspiring, delicious and slightly quirky treat.  Other dishes I've
personally invented include layering marmite and peanut butter on toast
and adding cucumber on top.  Surprisingly refreshing.
 
<p>Next time....... other things to do with Philadelphia.
